            These days, almost 15 years after it was first proposed, the clearfix is losing a bit of relevance.
            CSS Grid and Flexbox are filling in the gaps for advanced layout on the web. In January of 2017,
            Rachel Andrew wrote an article for her blog titled “The end of the clearfix hack?” In it, she describes
            a way to replace the clearfix hack with a single line of code using a new display mode rule known as flow-root.
