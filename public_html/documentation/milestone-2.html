            <strong>About me:</strong> My name is Jory Richards, and I am a multimedia professional and full stack web developer specializing in creating effective, eye-catching designs and fluid user experiences. I have been in this field for over nine years, and I have thrived in meeting the challenges of each of my clientâ€™s unique projects. I am a designer, developer, photographer, and overall a problem-solver. I am always trying to learn something new to keep up with current techniques and provide a first-class service. Please, check out my recent projects at the links below.

            <strong>Portfolio:</strong> This section will include examples of best work and any of my new projects. The content will be in either a carousel-type layout or large thumbnails; when clicked, it will enlarge and have a more detailed explanation of the project. I may also include a list of my training and qualifications, potentially linking to a redacted version of my resume.
